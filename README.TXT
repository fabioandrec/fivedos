                    ===================================


   With the great success of our product FiveWin: Clipper for Windows
   library, many users requested from us a similar product for MsDos.
   They were convinced that the power and easy of use of FiveWin should
   be also applied in MsDos.

   FiveDos is FiveWin concepts running on MsDos. If you already know
   FiveWin you also do know FiveDos. If you master FiveDos you will
   also know FiveWin. That is the great advantage of a cross-platform
   design.

   This is our first version. It is stable and you may use it to
   start developing your MsDos applications. Please contact us to
   help us enhance this product and take it as close as possible as
   our loved FiveWin.

   Enjoy it!
