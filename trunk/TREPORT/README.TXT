           쿑IVEWIN new Report Engine capabilities demonstration

These collection of samples provides a wide understanding about the new
powerfull built-in printing features of FiveWin.

All these examples have been developed by Ignacio Ortiz de Z＄iga based
on the new FiveWin 1.7 version which actually is ending the beta test
period.

The big advantage of using these built-in possibilities is that you do not
have to use any kind of external report aplications or third party runtimes
(If you do not want to, or you do not need to).

Any kind of report you could imagine can be easely designed in only few
minutes.

All the source code of these samples and the classes that have been used
are provided with new version of FiveWin 1.7. You may modify them to suite
your particular needs.

The major difference of FiveWin Report Engine against other third party
products is its capabilitie of previewing a report on the screen, going
forward and backwards page by page (it does not matter the length of the
report) and the user may print just the desired page/s which it is a great
possibility when working on graphical environment.

This is the real magic of CA-Clipper 5 and Microsoft Windows.

Please feel free to contact for any suggestions or questions.
